# 100-days-with-CSharp
a long term project, 100 days, 100 projects

# How did this started

Long story short, I was inspired by 100 days of code with python by Angela Yu

I feel like making my own version of 100 days but with C# instead

# Why C#?

It is mainly for the games, or its popularity, I got hooked up to monogame at some point

(also I do this to not procrastinate, feels like I have purpose)

# What you'll learn

- basics of C#
- make some games
- make some apps

# How do I start?

Start from the prologue, then day 1, day 2, day 3, well you get the point...
