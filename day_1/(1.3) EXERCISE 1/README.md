# Basic printing exercise

Your first exercise, it should be enough to cover up the basics of writeline and write

## Objective:

print out the following

- hello, this is me
- I can use 'Console.WriteLine()' now

the output should be something like this:
```
hello, this is me
I can use 'Console.WriteLine()' now
```

One step at a time, try use either write or writeline, have a go and see if you can solve it.

## hint

idk if u need this but, use Console.WriteLine() or Console.Write()
