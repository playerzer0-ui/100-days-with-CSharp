# SOLUTION

I hop you gave that one a good go, as it is important to not only memorize code, but to think like a problem solver, that is just the basic one though.

```csharp
internal class Program
{
    private static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("hello, this is me");
        Console.WriteLine("I can use 'Console.WriteLine()' now");
    }
}
```

Output:
```
hello, this is me
I can use 'Console.WriteLine()' now
```

just use 2 writelines and you are done.
