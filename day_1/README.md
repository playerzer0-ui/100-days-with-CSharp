# DAY 1

welcome to day 1

the project today is to make a simple access form. All it does is print out some text, take inputs and displays them (in this case, we take inputs into the name and age and outputs them).

the project could be found here:

https://replit.com/@playerzer0ui/AccessForm

by the end of this lesson, you will learn basic input and output, variables and the general structure of C#. A bit much, but just enough for anyone to get started.

start from 1.1, then work your way down.
